        <div class="col_right">
            <p>The Wild Boar (Sus scrofa) is the wild ancestor of the domestic pig. The Wild Boar lives in woodlands across much of Central Europe, the Mediterranean Region (including North Africas Atlas Mountains), and much of Asia as far south as Indonesia. Animals similar to the wild boar include the Warthog of Africa and the Peccary or Javelina of the American Southwest. The animals are swift, nocturnal, and omnivorous and are good swimmers. They possess sharp tusks, and, although they are normally unaggressive, they can be dangerous. The Wild Boar is an extremely adaptable animal.</p>

            <p>The Wild Boar is a medium-sized mammal with a large head and front end, that leads into a smaller hind. They have a thick and course double coat of fur, that consists of a harder, bristly top layer, with a softer undercoat beneath it. The hair that runs along the ridge of the Wild Boar’s back is also longer than the rest. The Wild Boar varies from brown, to black, to red or dark grey in colour, something which generally depends on the individual’s location. For example Wild Boar individuals found in Western Europe tend to be brown, where those inhabiting the forests of Eastern Europe can be completely black in colour. The Wild Boar has incredibly poor eyesight due to its very small-sized eyes, but they also have a long, straight snout which enables them to have an incredibly acute sense of smell.</p>

            <p>The Wild boars are commonly found and abundant animals, occurring throughout the globe, except for Antarctica. The natural habitat of this species covers parts of Europe and Asia. Additionally, the Wild boars have been introduced to South and North America. Currently, these animals are considered invaders throughout the southeastern United States and California. Preferred types of habitat are grassy savanna areas, wooded forests, agricultural areas, shrublands and marshy swamplands. Overall, Wild boars live in areas with a constant source of water and dense vegetative cover to serve them as refuge from predators.</p>

            <p>Wild boars live in groups called sounders. Sounders typically contain around 20 animals, but groups of over 50 have been seen. In a typical sounder there are two or three sows and their offspring; adult male Wild Boars are not part of the sounder outside of the autumnal breeding season and are usually found alone.</p>

        <p>Birth, called farrowing, usually occurs in the spring. A litter will typically contain five piglets, however, up to 13 piglets in one litter have been known. Breeding occurs year-round. Gestation period lasts for 108 - 120 days, yielding a litter of 4 - 6 piglets. Young are born in a nest, located among dense vegetation and constructed out of leaves, grass and moss. During the first 2 weeks, the female is almost constantly with her young to protect them from potential predators. At about 2 months of age, young boars start coming out of the nest to feed. Independence is reached within 7 months. Male Wild boars are ready to breed at 2 years old, whereas females are reproductively mature at 1 year of age.</p>

            <p>Wild boars are usually nocturnal, foraging from dusk until dawn but with resting periods during both night and day. This is because hunters are most active during the day. Wild boars eat almost anything they come across, including nuts, berries, carrion, roots, tubers,</p>

            <p>Wild boars are hunted both for their meat, tusks, and to mitigate the damage they cause to crops and forests. Wild Boars are now farmed in many places for their meat. meaning that populations even became extinct in some areas, such as Britain. Today however, Humans have introduced the Wild Boar to numerous different countries around the world, purely so that they can be hunted and eaten. The species as a whole has been threatened by habitat loss to Humans, mainly through deforestation and continuously growing settlements.</p>
